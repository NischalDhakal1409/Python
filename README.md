<h1> ðŸ’» Python Learning</h1>
I will be learning python programming from the basics and will be uploading everything that I have learned in this repository.
<h1> Resources</h1>
I am learning python currently following the tutorial from youtube. Beside that, any further resources that I will follow up in the future, I will upload over here

<h1>Introduction to Python </h1>
Python is a popular high level programming language. It is used in different fields like web development, data science, software development and system scripting. It is also used to connect with the database system and read and modify the files. It is popular because of it's simple syntax. In addition to this, it works on different platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. Also, it can be treated in procedural way or object oriented way or functional way.

<h1>Data Types in Python</h1>
In Python, Basically we have 4 different types of data types. They are
<ol>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>Integrer</li>
  <li>Floats</li>
  <li>Boolean</li>
</ol>
<br>

<ol>
  <li>String</li>
</ol>
String in python are denoted in either single quotation marks or double quotation marks. To assign a variable with string, we can write a variable name followed by equals to sign and string written in quotation. <br>
We can concat string in the python by using "+" symbol.<br><br>

<ol start = "2">
  <li>Integer</li>
</ol>
Integer are the whole number, negative or positive without a decimal. To assign a variable with integer, we can write a variable name followed by equals to sign and integer. <br>
We can combine integer and string in python by converting the integer in string form as shown below.
<br><br>

<ol start = "3">
  <li>Float</li>
</ol>
Float, "Floating Point Number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. To assign a variable with float, we can write a variable name followed by equals to sign and float. <br>
We can combine float and string in python by converting the float in string form as shown below.
<br><br>

<ol start ="4">
  <li>Boolean</li>
</ol>
Boolean represents either one of these values, true or false. It is often used to compare the two values. To assign a variable with boolean, we can write a variable name followed by equals to sign and boolean. <br>
We can combine boolean and string in python by converting the bolean in string form as shown below.
<br>
<br>
To know the type of the variable, we can find by using the "type"<br>
